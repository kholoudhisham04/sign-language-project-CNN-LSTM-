ðŸ“„ Project Details
This project aims to translate sign language into written text using artificial intelligence techniques (CNN + LSTM).

We used a dataset that contains sign language gestures representing the English alphabet (A-Z). Therefore, the system currently recognizes English sign language only.

The model works by processing a sequence of images (a short video) where each frame represents a gesture, and then it translates it into the corresponding letter.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used for training the model was obtained from Kaggle:
